        <h3>For the Pad Thai Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>5 Tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons rice vinegar, or Tamarind Paste</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons creamy peanut butter (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.</li>
            <li>Make sauce by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir Fry: Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.</li>
            <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</li>
            <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.</li>
            <li>Garnish the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
            <li>Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.</li>
        </ol>
